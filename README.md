# Mathblog-DBMS-Project
Mathblog is a question-and-answer web application for math enthusiasts and students who are struggling with math-related topics. This was my project on my Database Management System course and it uses the open-source MySQL relational database management system.

This web application is called 'MathBlog' and is a blog-style, question-and-answer web application where students or math enthusiasts can post their math-related topics, math questions, or homework and read entries or comments posted by other users on their posted math-related topics.
