# Mathblog-DBMS-Project
Mathblog is a question and answer web application for math enthusiasts and students who are struggling with their math related topics. This was my project on my Database Management System course and it uses the open-source MySQL relational-database management system.

This web application is called 'MathBlog' and is a blog style, question and  answer web application where students or math enthusiasts can post their math related topics, math questions or homeworks and read entries or comments posted by other users on their posted math related topics.
